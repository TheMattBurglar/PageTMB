This wasn't the first time I'd been called out to exorcise a demon from a machine. People are superstitious idiots, after all. But this was the first time the machine was the one claiming to be the demon.

Janeway was a little farming town about an hour's hover ride north of Artamis' version of Peoria. Don't ask me why every planet with people on it has a Peoria somewhere in the middle of one of the continents. I think it's an inside joke someone is playing, but I never bothered to figure it out.

The hover cab ride to Janeway dropped me off in the driveway of the town veterinarian's house. They'd obviously seen my cab ride up the road, because the veterinarian and her daughter were standing on their back porch to great me.
